# AiR-Platek-Kocha

## The program generates a [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) with a selected degree of depth into a selected ps file.



### My reflections:
Project I have written during my studies in Gdansk University of Techlonogy in 2016.
The program is written in C++.
Methods, variables and comments are in Polis.h
The program would be much shorter if was written in Python.
However, I think variable names and comments are very descriptive.
I wrote it a long time ago, but I feel comfortable reading it.
